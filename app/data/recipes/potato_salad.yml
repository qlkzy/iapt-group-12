    ingredients:
        - 225 g small new potatoes, scrubbed, cut into bite-sized pieces if necessary
        - 100 g runner beans, cut diagonally into slices
        - 325 g ripe mixed tomatoes, (e.g. plum tomatoes, quartered
          lengthways; yellow and red cherry tomatoes, halved; beefsteak
          tomatoes, cut into wedges)
        - 2 salad onions, thinly sliced
        - 100 g young spinach leaves
        - 1 ripe tomato, peeled and seeded
        - 1⁄2 tablespoon pesto
        - salt and freshly ground black pepper
        - 1 small lemon
        - 1 fat garlic clove, finely chopped
        - handful of flat-leaf parsley, roughly torn

    instructions:

    - Cook the potatoes in a large pan of lightly salted boiling water
      for 10-12 minutes or until just tender. Add the runner beans and
      cook for a further 2 minutes. Then drain and rinse under cold
      running water. Toss the potatoes and beans with the mixed
      tomatoes, salad onions and spinach and season to taste. For the
      gremolata, use a vegetable peeler to pare thin strips of rind
      from the lemon. Carefully remove as much white pith as possible
      (this is bitter). Finely chop the lemon rind and toss with the
      garlic and parsley. Season and set aside. Squeeze the juice from
      the lemon and whizz in a food processor with the peeled tomato
      and pesto for 10-15 seconds. Pour over the potato mixture and
      toss through. Scatter over the gremolata to serve.
