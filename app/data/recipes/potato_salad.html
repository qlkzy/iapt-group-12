<h2>Narrative Version</h2>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>225 g small new potatoes, scrubbed, cut into bite-sized pieces if necessary</li>
<li>100 g runner beans, cut diagonally into slices</li>
<li>325 g ripe mixed tomatoes, (e.g. plum tomatoes, quartered lengthways; yellow and red cherry tomatoes, halved; beefsteak tomatoes, cut into wedges)</li>
<li>2 salad onions, thinly sliced</li>
<li>100 g young spinach leaves</li>
<li>1 ripe tomato, peeled and seeded</li>
<li>1⁄2 tablespoon pesto</li>
<li>salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
<li>1 small lemon</li>
<li>1 fat garlic clove, finely chopped</li>
<li>handful of flat-leaf parsley, roughly torn</li>
</ul><h3>Instructions</h3><p>Cook the potatoes in a large pan of lightly salted boiling water for 10-12 minutes or until just tender. Add the runner beans and cook for a further 2 minutes. Then drain and rinse under cold running water. Toss the potatoes and beans with the mixed tomatoes, salad onions and spinach and season to taste. For the gremolata, use a vegetable peeler to pare thin strips of rind from the lemon. Carefully remove as much white pith as possible (this is bitter). Finely chop the lemon rind and toss with the garlic and parsley. Season and set aside. Squeeze the juice from the lemon and whizz in a food processor with the peeled tomato and pesto for 10-15 seconds. Pour over the potato mixture and toss through. Scatter over the gremolata to serve.</p>
