          pepper and onion. Reduce the heat to low, cover and cook for
          about 8 minutes. Add the cumin, garlic and chillies and cook for
          a further 2 minutes. Add the beans, tomatoes, vinegar and
          passata and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat and simmer
          rapidly for 10 minutes, until almost all the liquid has
          evaporated and the tomatoes start to look mushy.

          crumbled feta over the top. Cook under the hot grill until the

          chips on the side for dipping.
