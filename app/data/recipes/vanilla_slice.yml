    ingredients:
        - 2 sheets ready-rolled puff pastry
        - 1/2 c (110g) caster sugar
        - 1/2c (75g) cornflour
        - 1/4 c (30g) custard powder
        - 2 1/2c (625ml) milk
        - 30g butter
        - 1 egg yolk
        - 1tsp vanilla extract
        - 3/4c (180ml) thickened cream
        - 1 1/2c (240g) icing sugar
        - 1tsp soft butter
        - 1/4 c (60ml) passion fruit pulp

    instructions:

        - Set the oven to heat to a temperature of 240°C or 220°C with
          a fan assisted oven. Grease a 23cm square, deep edged, cake
          pan. Then line it with foil taking care to ensure the foil
          extends a minimum of 10cm over the edges.

        - Then grease two other oven trays to place (and bake) the
          ready-rolled pastry. Bake for approximately fifteen minutes
          and then cool. Gently flatten the sheets of pastry by hand.

        - Once done measure and trim the sheets to fit into the square
          cake pan. Place one of the sheets in the bottom of the cake
          pan pressing down gently.

        - At this point one mixes together the sugar, cornflour, and
          custard powder in a saucepan. Slowly add the milk till
          smooth and combined, without any lumps. Turn on the hob
          burner to medium high and set the saucepan on top. Add in
          the butter and stir as it melts and the mixture comes to a
          boil.

        - Continue to stir as it thickens, this usually takes around
          three minutes to attain a good thick consistency.

        - Now take it off the heat and stir in the egg yolk and
          vanilla extract, making sure to mix well and quickly. You
          can then cover it with cling film and set aside to cool down
          to room temperature.

        - Taking out a small saucepan and a heatproof bowl, set up a
          'water bath' on the hob by filling the saucepan 3/4 full
          with water and setting it to simmer (low boil). Pop the bowl
          on top in a lid-like capacity and then pop in the icing
          sugar, butter and passion fruit pulp from the icing
          list. Stir that all together over the simmering water until
          it melts together into a smooth pourable icing. Set aside.

        - In another bowl whip the thickened cream, with a hand mixer,
          until it forms stif peaks. Then gently fold half of the
          cream into the custard mixture at a time, using gentle
          motions and a rounded implement to reduce the number of
          bubbles in the cream that break.

        - Once all the whipped cream has been combined carefully then
          spread the mixture out over the puff pastry in the cake
          pan. Take care to make it as smooth as possible as you don't
          want air pockets under the top layer of pastry. When your
          happy with that, gently place the second measured slice of
          puff pastry on top, pressing down a bit to 'seat' the pastry
          into the custard.

        - Pour the icing on top, spreading gently so as not to
          disturbed what ever flakiness the top pastry has. Cover and
          cool for a minimum of three hours or overnight.

        - Opening your package of puff pastry and removing two
