<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li>2 sheets ready-rolled puff pastry</li>
<li>1/2 c (110g) caster sugar</li>
<li>1/2c (75g) cornflour</li>
<li>1/4 c (30g) custard powder</li>
<li>2 1/2c (625ml) milk</li>
<li>30g butter</li>
<li>1 egg yolk</li>
<li>1tsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>3/4c (180ml) thickened cream</li>
<li>1 1/2c (240g) icing sugar</li>
<li>1tsp soft butter</li>
<li>1/4 c (60ml) passion fruit pulp</li>
</ul><h3>Instructions</h3><p>Set the oven to heat to a temperature of 240°C or 220°C with a fan assisted oven. Grease a 23cm square, deep edged, cake pan. Then line it with foil taking care to ensure the foil extends a minimum of 10cm over the edges.</p>
<p>Then grease two other oven trays to place (and bake) the ready-rolled pastry. Bake for approximately fifteen minutes and then cool. Gently flatten the sheets of pastry by hand.</p>
<p>Once done measure and trim the sheets to fit into the square cake pan. Place one of the sheets in the bottom of the cake pan pressing down gently.</p>
<p>At this point one mixes together the sugar, cornflour, and custard powder in a saucepan. Slowly add the milk till smooth and combined, without any lumps. Turn on the hob burner to medium high and set the saucepan on top. Add in the butter and stir as it melts and the mixture comes to a boil.</p>
<p>Continue to stir as it thickens, this usually takes around three minutes to attain a good thick consistency.</p>
<p>Now take it off the heat and stir in the egg yolk and vanilla extract, making sure to mix well and quickly. You can then cover it with cling film and set aside to cool down to room temperature.</p>
<p>Taking out a small saucepan and a heatproof bowl, set up a 'water bath' on the hob by filling the saucepan 3/4 full with water and setting it to simmer (low boil). Pop the bowl on top in a lid-like capacity and then pop in the icing sugar, butter and passion fruit pulp from the icing list. Stir that all together over the simmering water until it melts together into a smooth pourable icing. Set aside.</p>
<p>In another bowl whip the thickened cream, with a hand mixer, until it forms stif peaks. Then gently fold half of the cream into the custard mixture at a time, using gentle motions and a rounded implement to reduce the number of bubbles in the cream that break.</p>
<p>Once all the whipped cream has been combined carefully then spread the mixture out over the puff pastry in the cake pan. Take care to make it as smooth as possible as you don't want air pockets under the top layer of pastry. When your happy with that, gently place the second measured slice of puff pastry on top, pressing down a bit to 'seat' the pastry into the custard.</p>
<p>Pour the icing on top, spreading gently so as not to disturbed what ever flakiness the top pastry has. Cover and cool for a minimum of three hours or overnight.</p>
