      \begin{itemize}
      \item 0 - not a usability problem in the opinion of the expert
      \item 1 - a cosmetic problem that is an irritant to the user but will not interrupt their progress much
      \item 2 - a minor problem that will interrupt the user's task, but they will be able to recover (also for problems that will likely only occur once)
      \item 3 - a major problem that will interrup the user's task for a long period of time; the user will have to fall back to some problem solving skills to move on in their task
      \item 4 - a usability catastrophe (very major problem) that will stop the user from proceeding in their task: used for issues that render the user unable to continue (e.g. trapped in dialogue) or that will probably cause the user to give up (e.g. lost in the information architecture of the website)
