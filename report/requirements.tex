\section{Functional Requirements}
Design research and devising of personas/scenarios led to a distillation of the core functional requirements a recipe app would need in order to be successful. This set of requirements was further partitioned into two distinct subsets, the subsets representing the two core components of the app.

\subsection{Recipe Browsing}
Users must be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item search for recipes using a full or partial recipe name;
\item view a list of all recipes that are present in the application's database of recipes;
\item filter any list of recipes using specific filtration criteria.
\end{itemize}
