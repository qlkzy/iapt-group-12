\section{Functional Requirements}
Design research and devising of personas/scenarios led to a distillation of the core functional requirements a recipe app would need in order to be successful. This set of requirements was further partitioned into two distinct subsets, the subsets representing the two core components of the app.

\subsection{Recipe Browsing}
Users must be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item search for recipes using a full or partial recipe name;
\item view a list of all recipes that are present in the application's database of recipes;
\item filter any list of recipes using specific filtration criteria.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Recipe Viewing}
Users must be able to:
\begin{itemize}
\item see general information about a recipe both when browsing multiple recipes and when viewing a single recipe;
\item see the ingredients required to complete a recipe;
\item see the instructions that need to be followed in order to complete a recipe;
\item change the level of detail in which recipe instructions are presented to them;
\item set the default level of detail in which all recipe instructions are presented to them;
\item mark instructions as completed through some interation.
\end{itemize}
