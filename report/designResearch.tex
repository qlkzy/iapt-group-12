\section*{Rating User Interfaces}
Based on the Shneiderman's Principles of Interaction Design, Don Norman's Design Principles and Tog's First Principles of Interaction Design, these criteria have be identified as a solid starting point for any user interface.

\subsection*{The Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Consistency;
  \item Informative feedback to the user;
  \item Straightforward reversal of actions;
  \item Promoting internal locus of control;
  \item Low short-term memory load;
  \item High feature visibility;
  \item Information readability;
\end{itemize}

\section*{The Interfaces}
Two interfaces related to the topic of the assessment were chosen for analysis.

\subsection*{AllRecipes}
A website with a great diversity of content and a site that employs various forms 
of media to deliver information to its users. The site offers limited anonymous
use, restricted to browsing content only. With membership comes full access to 
site features, including the provisions for submitting recipes, uploading
photographs of completed dishes, saving recipes and creating shopping lists.

\subsection*{BigOven}
A website and application that runs on both Windows and mobile platforms, BigOven
boasts one of the largest recipe collections available online (250 000+). As well
as recipe organization and display, BigOven provides nutritional calculcations,
an integrated meal planner, recipe importation, shopping list generators and even 
a cookbook creator.
