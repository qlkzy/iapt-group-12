\section*{Rating User Interfaces}
Based on the Shneiderman's Principles of Interaction Design, Don Norman's Design Principles and Tog's First Principles of Interaction Design, these criteria have be identified as a solid starting point for any user interface. A feature of an examined interface which demonstrates good use of one of these guidelines scores a single point; a feature of an examined interface which demonstrates something that directly contradicts one these guidelines scores a single negative point, as will a distinct lack of following any single principle throughout the interface.
\subsection*{The Criteria}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Consistency;
  \item Shortcuts for frequent users;
  \item Informative feedback to the user;
  \item Closure-yielding dialogue;
  \item Simple error-handling;
  \item Straightforward reversal of actions;
  \item Promoting internal locus of control;
  \item Low short-term memory load;
  \item High feature visibility;
  \item Constrained user interactions;
  \item Logical mapping between control \& effect;
  \item Feature affordance;
  \item Anticipitative design;
  \item Information readability;

\section*{The Interfaces}
Three interfaces related to the topic of the assessment were chosen for analysis.

\subsection*{AllRecipes}
A website with a great diversity of content and a site that employs various forms 
of media to deliver information to its users. The site offers limited anonymous
use, restricted to browsing content only.
